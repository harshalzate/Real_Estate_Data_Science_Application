In this comprehensive capstone project primary focus was on leveraging data science techniques to provide insights,prediction and recommendation in the real estate domain. 
The project unfolds through various stages covering data gathering, cleaning, EDA, modeling, recommendation systems and the deployment of the user-friendly application.

# Data Gathering 
The project commmenced with the collection of real estate data which was scraped from 99acres website. Similar datasets from other property listing website were also explored ensuring diverse
and representative dataset.

# Data Cleaning and Merging:
To prepare dataset for analysis, a meticulous data cleaning process was undertaken, handeling and ensuring missing value and ensuring consistency. 
That data was then merged, bringing together information on houses and flats into a unified dataset.
